# mdmerge

I developed `mdmerge` for my own usage.
I was tired to update my main `README.md` file
when it contains some codes (all or part of) from an existing file.

When the source file change, your `README.md` must be manually updated.

So I create my own **Node.js** application to update my `README.md`
which using other files thanks to a custom instruction which is
invisible in the rendered document (also in PDF document).

Currently, the application is not fully finished but the main feature are finished.


## Getting Start


### The Command Line Interface

The simpliest command line to merge your **Markdown** is ``mdmerge <FILE>.md``.
By default, the command line creates a new file nammed ``<FILE>.merged.md``.
I choose to do this to prevent breaks on the source file.

The command line have two **implicits** options :
* The first one will stands for the **input file** to merge.
* The second one will stands for the **output file** to put the result.

Examples with **implicits** options : 
1. ``mdmerge <INPUT_FILE>.md <OUTPUT_FILE>.md`` : The merged document from
``<INPUT_FILE>.md`` will be place in the output file `<OUTPUT_FILE>.md`
2. ``mdmerge <INPUT_FILE>.md <INPUT_FILE>.md`` : Done like this, you will overwrite
your source file will the result.

The second case ``2.`` can be simply with the following command :
``mdmerge <FILE>.md -w``



### Implicit Options

This application allows **implicits** options.
**Implicits** options are the values which not begins with a hyphen char (`-`).
They are determined with their position behind the **command** (`mdmerge`).

On the following example ``mdmerge -c README.md README.final.md``,
the first **implicit** option is ``README.md`` and the second is `README.final.md`.

**Implicits** options priority is lesser than **Explicits** ones.



#### Implicit Option ``1``

The first **implicit** option stands for the file to merge. It's is equal
to the option ``-i``, `--in`.



#### Implicit Option ``2``

The second **implicit** option stands for the output file. It's is equal
to the option ``-o``, `--out`.






### Command Line Options

Please find below the detail of each options for
the command ``mdmerge``.

**Be warned** : **Explicit** options have the priority on the **implicit** ones.

**Be warned** : The **long options** have the **priority** on the **short ones**.
For instance, if you use at the same time options ``-i=file_1`` and
``--in=file_2``, this is the file `file_2` which will be processed.


#### Option ``-i``, `--in` : Input file

The option ``-i`` (`--in`) allows you to specified
the input file to merged.

* It requires a value.
* The input must be a **file** which exists.
* It equal to the implicit options `1`.



#### Option ``-o``, `--out` : Output file

The option ``-o`` (`--out`) allows you to specified
the target file in which the result will be placed.

* It requires a value.
* The output must be a **file**. If the file not exists, it will be created. 
* It equal to the implicit options `2`.

This option will have no effect if option ``-w`` (`--write`) is used.



#### Option ``-w``, `--write` : Overwrite

The option ``-w`` (`--write`) allows you to directly
**overwrite** the input file with the result.

* It does not requires a value.



#### Option ``-c``, `--clear` : Clear

The option ``-c`` (`--clear`) allows you to remove
merged content between tags.

* It does not requires a value.






### The Instruction

The detailed instruction hereafter must be placed at the begin of the line
in a comment block in your Markdown file : ``[](<instruction>)``

Once parsed by `mdmerge`, a closing instruction has been inserted.
That will allows the application to update the included parts.

Please find below, the generic form of the instruction `<instruction>` :

The element separator is the colon char (`:`)

* `<instruction>` = `@import><pathToFile>[..:<inclusionInstruction>][:[<codeBlockLanguage>]]`
	* `<pathToFile>` : This is the relative path to the file used for this inclusion.
	* `:<inclusionInstruction>` : You can insert none to many of the inclusion instruction separated by `:`.
* `<inclusionInstruction` = `<line>[,<startOffset>][,<endOffset>]`
	* `<line>` : You can specified the line to toggle the inclusion.
	* `<startOffset>` : You can specified from which char you want to begin the inclusion on the line.
	* `<endOffset>` : You can specified when you stop the inclusion on the line
* `:<codeBlockLanguage>` : You can ask to `mdmerge` to insert your content in a Markdown code block
in a specified language. You can omit `<codeBlockLanguage>` to let your favorite render to identify
automatically the language (Example with **Highligh.js**)

The `<inclusionInstruction>` toggle the inclusion.

The generic rule is the **odds** elements will start the inclusion whereas the **evens** will
stop the inclusion. When the total number of `<inclusionInstruction>` is **odd**, the last
inclusion process will inclusion until the **EOF** is met.

Please find an example of instruction :

````markdown
 [](@import>bin/mdmerge.js:53:79:js)
````

The instruction can be read as
"Please, include here the JavaScript code from file `mdmerge.js`,
from line `53` to line `79` in a code block `js`".

The result is the following

[](#import>bin/mdmerge.js:53:79:js)
````js
/**
 * Afficher un message dans le stream.
 *
 * @param message Message Ã  afficher
 * @param level   Niveau de message. 0=OK,1=KO,2=WARN
 */
function log(message, level = 0, args = []){
	// 0 = Success
	// 1 = Error
	// 2 = Warn
	let levels = [
		{color: "Green", name: "SUCCESS", return: 0},
		{color: "Red", name: "ERROR", return: 1},
		{color: "Yellow", name: "WARNING", return: 0},
	];
	
	console.log(
		"[ " +
		colors.fg[levels[level].color] +
		levels[level].name +
		colors.Reset +
		" ] : " +
		message
	);

	return levels[level].return;
}
